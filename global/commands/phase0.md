# `/phase0` Command Specification — Final

> **Phase 0: From Idea to Intake-Ready Documentation**
> Designed as a pre-stage for the [workflow-system](https://github.com/carlos-andres/workflow-system)
> Version: 1.0 — February 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

A single Claude Code slash command that conducts an adaptive, cascading interview to transform a raw project idea into structured documentation ready for `/constitution` → `/intake`.

**Input:** A rough idea (one sentence, a paragraph, an ASCII sketch, a screenshot — anything).
**Output:** 4 living documents + 1 comprehensive README.md that bridges Phase 0 into the workflow-system.

### Quick Reference

```bash
/phase0 {idea}          # Start new Phase 0 with an idea
/phase0                  # Start new (Claude asks for idea)
/phase0 resume           # Resume an existing Phase 0 session
```

---

## 2. Where This Fits

```
/phase0 "my project idea"
  ├── Cascading interview
  ├── 4 docs in .devwork/_scratch/phase0/
  └── Generates comprehensive README.md
       │
       ▼
/constitution (reads README, generates AI coding guidelines)
       │
       ▼
/intake → /research → /spec → /plan → implement → /deliver → /graduate
```

Phase 0 is the **only command that runs before any code exists**. It creates just enough structure and documentation for `/constitution` to take over.

---

## 3. Document Architecture

### 3.1 — Working Documents (during interview)

```
.devwork/
└── _scratch/
    └── phase0/
        ├── 01-idea.md          # Vision & problem statement
        ├── 02-discovery.md     # Interview findings & analysis
        ├── 03-decisions.md     # ADRs & project rules/constraints
        └── 04-specs.md         # Technical & UI specifications
```

### 3.2 — Final Output (on completion)

```
project-root/
└── README.md               # Comprehensive project README
                             # Consolidates all 4 docs into a single
                             # source of truth for /constitution
```

### Why this structure?

- `.devwork/_scratch/` is the workflow-system's designated temporary workspace
- No `/constitution` or `/init` required — zero friction to start
- Phase 0 only creates `.devwork/_scratch/phase0/` — nothing else
- The README.md is the bridge: it gives `/constitution` enough context to generate AI coding guidelines even without code
- When `/constitution` eventually runs, it creates the rest of `.devwork/` (decisions/, specs/, feature/, etc.)

## 5. Command Behavior

### 5.1 — Invocation

```bash
/phase0 {idea description}    # Start new Phase 0 with an idea
/phase0                        # Start new Phase 0 (Claude asks for the idea)
/phase0 resume                 # Resume an existing Phase 0 session
```

**On startup (new):**
1. Check if `.devwork/_scratch/phase0/` exists
   - If it exists and flag is NOT `resume` → ask: "There's an existing Phase 0. Resume it, or start fresh (will backup existing to `_scratch/phase0-{timestamp}/`)?"
   - If it exists and flag IS `resume` → go directly to resume flow
   - If it doesn't exist → create it and proceed
2. Create `.devwork/_scratch/phase0/` (only this — nothing else)
3. Generate initial `01-idea.md` draft from the provided description
4. Begin the adaptive interview

**On startup (resume):**
1. Read all 4 existing documents in `.devwork/_scratch/phase0/`
2. Present a status summary of what's already captured
3. Identify where the interview left off based on document completeness
4. Suggest: "Last time we covered X, Y, Z. Want to continue from there or focus on something specific?"
5. Resume the adaptive interview — documents continue updating as normal

### 5.2 — Interview Flow

The interview follows an **adaptive cascade** — not a fixed script.

**Opening moves (always):**
1. What is this project? (if not already provided)
2. What problem does it solve?
3. Who is it for?
4. Does anything like this exist already?

**Adaptive middle (driven by user responses):**

| If the user mentions...   | Claude pivots to asking about...                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI / screens / layout     | Components, states, interactions, responsive behavior       |
| Data / storage            | Entities, relationships, volume, persistence                |
| API / integrations        | Endpoints, auth, rate limits, error handling                |
| Constraints / rules       | Rationale, scope of constraint, alternatives considered     |
| Tech stack preferences    | Compatibility, tradeoffs, experience level                  |
| Users / roles             | Permissions, flows per role, edge cases                     |
| Performance concerns      | Benchmarks, expected load, caching strategy                 |
| Existing tool / reference | What to borrow, what to change, competitive analysis        |

**Key interview principles:**
- **One question at a time** — never overwhelm
- **Acknowledge first** — reflect what the user shared before asking next
- **Visual triggers** — if the user shares ASCII art, a table, or a screenshot, process it immediately and ask clarifying questions about that specific element
- **Capture decisions instantly** — any "I want X" or "only Y" statement becomes an ADR
- **Natural grouping** — don't jump between topics randomly
- **No fixed length** — the interview runs as long as the user wants

### 5.3 — Document Updates

**When to update:**
- After each substantive exchange (not every single message)
- Decision or rule mentioned → immediate update to `03-decisions.md`
- Visual/UI element described → immediate update to `04-specs.md`
- Synthesis and insights → update `02-discovery.md` periodically
- Problem/vision refinement → update `01-idea.md`

**Notification behavior:**
```
📝 Updated 04-specs.md — added toolbar component specs
```
- One line, brief, after each update
- Name the file and what changed
- Do NOT show document content in the notification
- Do NOT interrupt the conversation flow

**Status on demand:**
The user can ask "status", "show me the docs", "where are we?", "how are the docs looking?" at any time. Claude responds with:
```
Phase 0 Status:
📄 01-idea.md — Problem and vision defined, 2 target user groups identified
📄 02-discovery.md — 6 topics covered, 3 open questions remain
📄 03-decisions.md — 3 decisions, 2 rules captured
📄 04-specs.md — 4 features, 2 UI components, tech stack defined
```
This does NOT trigger completion.

### 5.4 — Language Rules

- **Conversation:** In whatever language the user is speaking
- **Documents:** Always in English (industry standard)
- **Technical terms:** Keep in English even in non-English conversation (e.g., "toolbar", "API", "middleware", "scaffold")

### 5.5 — Handling User Artifacts

When the user shares visual or structured content:

**ASCII art / diagrams:**
- Acknowledge and incorporate into `04-specs.md`
- Generate a structured breakdown (table of elements + functions)
- Ask specific questions about each element
- The user will be explicit when sharing something that needs specs

**Screenshots / images:**
- Analyze visible elements
- Ask clarifying questions about intent vs. current state
- Document in `04-specs.md` with references

**Tables / structured data:**
- Incorporate directly into the relevant document
- Ask about missing columns, edge cases, or states

### 5.6 — Completion

**Trigger phrases (explicit only):**
- "estoy listo" / "estoy contento"
- "phase0 done"
- "listo para intake" / "ready for intake"
- "terminamos" / "done"
- Any unambiguous signal that the user is finished

**What does NOT trigger completion:**
- "ya creo que está bien" (ambiguous — could be about a single answer)
- "por ahora así" (sounds like a pause)
- Asking about status or reviewing docs
- Saying "looks good" about a specific section

**On completion — 3 steps:**

**Step 1: Final status report**
```
Phase 0 Complete ✅

📄 01-idea.md — Complete
📄 02-discovery.md — 8 topics covered, 2 open questions
📄 03-decisions.md — 4 decisions, 3 rules captured
📄 04-specs.md — 5 features specified, 2 UI components

⚠️ Open items:
- Authentication strategy not yet decided
- Mobile responsive behavior not discussed
```

**Step 2: Generate README.md**
Consolidate all 4 documents into a comprehensive README.md at the project root (see template in section 4.5). This is the primary deliverable that bridges Phase 0 to `/constitution`.

**Step 3: Suggest next step**
```
📋 README.md generated at project root.
   → Run `/constitution` to generate AI coding guidelines.
   → Constitution will read your README and set up .devwork/ structure.
   → After that, use `/intake` to start your first task.
```

The user is never forced to address open items — they decide if it's good enough to proceed.

---

## 6. Integration with Workflow System

### 6.1 — The README Bridge

The README.md is the handoff artifact between Phase 0 and the workflow-system. Here's how `/constitution` uses it:

| README Section | Constitution Uses It For |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Tech Stack | Detect language, framework, tools |
| Architecture | Understand project structure |
| Development Guidelines | Seed AI coding conventions |
| Project Rules & Constraints | Inform "Do NOT Touch" section |
| Planned Directory Structure | Validate constitution structure suggestions |

Because the README is thorough, `/constitution` can generate useful AI coding guidelines even with zero code. When code is eventually written, `/constitution update` re-scans and enriches the guidelines with real patterns.

### 6.2 — Phase 0 Docs After Constitution

The 4 working documents in `_scratch/phase0/` remain available as reference:

| Phase 0 Document | Later Used By | How |
|-------------------|--------------|-----|
| `01-idea.md` | `/intake` | Context for task classification |
| `02-discovery.md` | `/research` | Pre-populates research, reduces exploration |
| `03-decisions.md` | `/graduate` | Seeds graduated ADRs in `.devwork/decisions/` |
| `04-specs.md` | `/spec` + `/plan` | Foundation of working spec and implementation plan |

### 6.3 — No Lock-in

- Phase 0 docs are drafts in `_scratch/` — they can be edited, discarded, or archived
- The workflow-system's `/graduate` command handles promotion to permanent locations
- If something from Phase 0 changes during development, the workflow handles iteration naturally
- Phase 0 does NOT modify any existing workflow-system commands or behavior

---

## 7. Example Session

```
> /phase0 A web app to compare .env files side by side

📝 Created .devwork/_scratch/phase0/
📝 Created 01-idea.md — initial draft

Great, a .env file comparison tool. Let me understand the problem.
What specifically goes wrong today — are you comparing environments
(dev vs prod), looking for missing keys, checking values, or all of the above?

> Mainly comparing environments. I always mess up because I forget
> to add new keys to production. Also want to see which values differ.

📝 Updated 01-idea.md — problem statement refined
📝 Updated 02-discovery.md — Round 1: core problem

That's a real pain point. Is this for you personally or for a team?
And would it be an internal tool or something you'd share publicly?

> For me and my team, 5 devs. Internal only.

📝 Updated 01-idea.md — target users defined

Got it. What does the comparison look like in your head?
Two panels side by side? A diff view? Something else?

> Dual panel. Left = one .env, right = another. And I have a toolbar:
>
> ┌────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
> │     Button     │          Function           │
> ├────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
> │ ← Back         │ Return to file selection    │
> │ Order L/Both/R │ Reorganize by prefix groups │
> │ ⇅ Collapse     │ Hide identical keys         │
> │ ↕ Sync         │ Synchronized scrolling      │
> │ ?              │ Keyboard shortcuts help     │
> │ Save L/R       │ Save file left or right     │
> └────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

📝 Updated 04-specs.md — dual panel layout + toolbar with 6 elements

Clear layout. A few questions about the toolbar.
The "Order L/Both/R" — does this mean you can reorder only the
left panel, only the right, or both simultaneously?

> All three options — left only, right only, or both. Groups keys
> by prefix like DB_, AWS_, APP_. Also, a decision: we only edit
> .env files. Never .yaml, .json, or anything else.

📝 Updated 04-specs.md — Order button: 3 states clarified
📝 Updated 03-decisions.md — DEC-001: Only .env file support

Captured as a project decision. Now about "Collapse" — when
identical keys are hidden, is there a count showing how many
are collapsed? And can you toggle them back?

> Yes, show the count. Toggle with the same button.

📝 Updated 04-specs.md — Collapse button: toggle + counter

> status

Phase 0 Status:
📄 01-idea.md — Problem defined, target users (5-dev team, internal)
📄 02-discovery.md — 4 topics covered (problem, users, UI layout, toolbar)
📄 03-decisions.md — 1 decision (DEC-001: .env only)
📄 04-specs.md — 1 view (dual panel), 1 component (toolbar, 6 elements)

Open: tech stack, file selection flow, diff highlighting, error handling

> The stack will be React + Vite for frontend, no backend needed —
> it reads local files via the File System API.
> And another decision: no backend, purely client-side.

📝 Updated 04-specs.md — tech stack defined
📝 Updated 03-decisions.md — DEC-002: Client-side only, no backend

Interesting choice — purely client-side. That simplifies a lot.
How do users select which files to compare? Drag and drop?
File picker? Paste content?

> File picker for both sides. Maybe drag and drop later but not MVP.

📝 Updated 04-specs.md — file selection: file picker (drag-drop out of scope)
📝 Updated 01-idea.md — added drag-drop to Out of Scope

> estoy listo

Phase 0 Complete ✅

📄 01-idea.md — Complete
📄 02-discovery.md — 6 topics covered, 1 open question
📄 03-decisions.md — 2 decisions, 0 rules
📄 04-specs.md — 2 features, 1 UI component, stack defined

⚠️ Open items:
- Diff highlighting behavior not discussed (color coding, inline vs side-by-side markers)

📝 README.md generated at project root.
   → Run `/constitution` to generate AI coding guidelines.
   → Constitution will read your README and set up .devwork/ structure.
   → After that, use `/intake` to start your first task.
```

---

## 8. Resumability

Phase 0 is designed to survive interruptions. Documents are saved progressively, so nothing is lost if Claude Code closes mid-interview.

**To resume:**
```bash
/phase0 resume
```

This reads all existing docs, shows a status summary, and picks up where you left off. See section 5.1 for full resume behavior.

**If you run `/phase0` without `resume` and docs already exist:**
Claude asks whether to resume or start fresh. Starting fresh backs up existing docs to `_scratch/phase0-{timestamp}/` so nothing is lost.

---

## 9. Multiple Projects

If the user wants to run Phase 0 for multiple ideas:

- First run: `.devwork/_scratch/phase0/`
- User can rename the folder before starting another: `.devwork/_scratch/phase0-envtool/`
- Or Claude can ask on second invocation: "There's already a Phase 0 in progress. Start a new one alongside it or replace it?"

---

## 10. Implementation Notes

**As a Claude Code slash command:**
- Single file: `~/.claude/commands/phase0.md` (global) or in the workflow-system repo under `global/commands/phase0.md`
- Contains all behavior instructions, document templates, and interview logic
- Uses `$ARGUMENTS` for the optional initial idea description
- No external dependencies — no npm, no scripts, just a markdown prompt

**Compatibility:**
- Works with the existing workflow-system without modifications
- The command is purely additive — it doesn't change any existing commands
- Constitution's `repair` and `update` flags handle the partial `.devwork/` structure gracefully

**Estimated command size:** ~250-350 lines of markdown instructions
